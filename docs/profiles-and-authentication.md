# Profiles and authentication

`txc` separates **who you are** from **where commands run**:

- **Credential**: how you authenticate.
- **Connection**: the target environment or provider endpoint.
- **Profile**: a named combination of credential and connection.

Every command that talks to a live environment takes one context flag: `--profile <name>`.
Instead of passing raw connection details on every command, you create profiles once and reuse them.

## Active profile resolution

`txc` resolves the active profile in this order:

```text
--profile flag > TXC_PROFILE env > <repo>/.txc/workspace.json > global active pointer (~/.txc/config.json)
```

## Secret storage

Credentials are not stored as plaintext in config files.

- Service principal secrets, PATs, and certificate passwords are stored in the OS credential vault.
- Config files keep opaque `vault://` references.
- MSAL tokens live in a separate cache protected by the same vault mechanism.

## Interactive workflow

The fastest setup on a developer machine is usually a single command:

```sh
txc config profile create --url https://contoso.crm4.dynamics.com/
```

That command creates the profile and selects it as the active profile.

If you want to bootstrap the profile without switching the active context:

```sh
txc config profile create --url https://contoso.crm4.dynamics.com/ --no-select
```

If you want the explicit building blocks, use the primitive commands instead:

```sh
# 1. Sign in interactively and create a credential entry.
txc config auth login

# 2. Register the environment you want to target.
txc config connection create customer-a-dev \
  --provider dataverse \
  --environment https://contoso.crm4.dynamics.com/

# 3. Combine credential + connection into a profile and select it.
txc config profile create --name customer-a-dev \
  --auth <upn-alias> \
  --connection customer-a-dev
txc config profile select customer-a-dev

# 4. Optionally pin the profile to the current repository.
txc config profile pin

# 5. Validate the setup end to end.
txc config profile validate
```

Unpin a repository-level profile with:

```sh
txc config profile unpin
```

## Sign-in is manual — including when a coding agent is driving `txc`

`txc` never starts an interactive browser sign-in or a device-code flow on
anyone's behalf. `txc config auth login` and `txc config profile create --url`
only run an interactive flow when a human deliberately invokes them, in their
own terminal, and only when a browser is actually reachable — there is no
silent fallback to device-code if it isn't. If a token has expired or no
credential exists yet, every affected command fails fast with an error asking
for a **manual** `txc config auth login` (or `--device-code` explicitly, if
that's genuinely what's needed) instead of starting a flow no one is watching.

If you are scripting or delegating work to a coding agent:

- Sign in yourself, once, ahead of time — in a CI runner or agent sandbox, use
  the [headless workflow](#headless-and-ci-workflow) below instead of
  interactive sign-in.
- Before creating a new profile or connection, run `txc config profile list`
  and `txc config connection list` first — reuse an existing one that already
  targets the environment you need instead of letting an agent create one
  speculatively.

## Headless and CI workflow

For CI runners and other non-interactive environments, isolate config and load the secret from an environment variable:

```sh
export TXC_CONFIG_DIR="$RUNNER_TEMP/txc-config"
export TXC_NON_INTERACTIVE=1
export SPN_SECRET='<client-secret>'

txc config auth add-service-principal \
  --tenant "$AZURE_TENANT_ID" \
  --client-id "$AZURE_CLIENT_ID" \
  --alias ci-spn \
  --secret-from-env SPN_SECRET

txc config connection create ci-target \
  --provider dataverse \
  --environment "$DATAVERSE_URL"

txc config profile create --name ci --auth ci-spn --connection ci-target
txc config profile select ci
```

After that, all subsequent `txc` commands use `TXC_CONFIG_DIR` plus the selected profile.

For workload identity federation, register the app without a secret:

```sh
txc config auth add-federated \
  --tenant "$AZURE_TENANT_ID" \
  --client-id "$AZURE_CLIENT_ID" \
  --alias ci-wif
```

At token acquisition time, the Dataverse provider auto-detects the expected GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps token request environment variables (or `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`).

## Override the target for one command

Use `--profile` when you want to hit a different environment without switching the active default:

```sh
txc env sln import ./Solutions/MySolution_managed.zip --profile customer-b-prod
```
